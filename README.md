# ply_to_splat
A Python funtion/script to convert Gaussian Splatting .ply files to .splat files.
As part of this conversion all information about spherical harmonics and accordingly view-dependent effects is lost.

This is usable as a script through setting the "ply_file_to_convert" and "output_filename" variables or through importing the function and using it yourself.
